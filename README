This Logitech Media Server (LMS) plugin allows the audio track of Pluzz videos to be played on any Squeezebox. 

It chooses the smallest video resolution to minimize bandwidth usage. Please note that the whole file is streamed to the LMS server, not only the audio. SOCKS is supported for abroad usage
